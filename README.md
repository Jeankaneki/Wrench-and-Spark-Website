# Wrench & Spark: Online Tool Emporium
Wrench & Spark is a user-friendly, responsive e-commerce website designed for a specialized online tool retailer. The project was born from a frustration with the lack of reliable, high-quality online stores for professional and hobbyist mechanics. This platform aims to provide customers with durability and performance at a fair price by sourcing tools directly from trusted manufacturers.
## Mission and Vision
* Mission Statement: To empower every mechanic, from the professional in the pit garage to the DIY enthusiast in their home garage, with the highest quality tools, expert advice, and unparalleled customer service.
* Vision Statement: To become the most trusted and go-to online destination for automotive tools and equipment in the region.
## Key Features
* Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
* Product Showcase: A clean and organized product grid to display tools with images, descriptions, and pricing.
* Category Filtering: Users can easily filter products by categories such as "Hand Tools," "Power Tools," and "Diagnostics."
* Static Pages: Includes essential pages like Home, About Us, Products, and Contact.
* Interactive UI: Smooth transitions and hover effects create an engaging user experience.
* Newsletter Subscription: A footer section for users to subscribe to updates and special offers.
## Target Audience
This website is designed for:
* Professional mechanics and automotive technicians.
* Serious DIY car enthusiasts and hobbyists.
* Automotive repair shops looking to equip their teams.
* Vocational and technical schools for their training programs.
## Design and User Experience
The design choices were made to create a professional, trustworthy, and clean aesthetic that reflects the quality of the products.
* Color Palette:
   * #003366 (Prussian Blue): Evokes trust, professionalism, and reliability. Used for the header, footer, and primary buttons.
   * #FF7900 (Safety Orange): A vibrant accent color that signifies energy and action. Used for logos, highlights, and call-to-action buttons.
   * #f8f9fa (Light Gray): A clean and neutral background color that improves readability.
* Typography:
   * Roboto Condensed: Used for headings to provide a strong, modern, and technical feel.
   * Roboto: Used for body text for its high readability and clean appearance.
## Technologies Used
This project is built entirely with front-end technologies, focusing on a clean and maintainable codebase.
